This script takes an image as the input and returns the orientation of objects within a specific range of specific HSV values. 

Upcoming Changes:
  1. Implementation of a color filtering algorithm replacing hardcoded HSV thresholds.
  2. Applying image manipulation to a video stream instead of single images.
  3. Refining contour detection.
